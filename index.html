                            the Las Vegas Raiders benched the veteran QB for their final two games, both losses, as they

                        <h2>J.J. Watt on retirement: 'I know I still can (play), I'm just choosing not to'</h2>
                        <p>Watt indeed showed he can still play, sacking 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy twice in
                            Arizona's
                            loss
                            to
                            San Francisco on Sunday and adding five tackles (three for loss) and a pass defensed. In the
                            final
                            game
                            of his 12-year career,
                            Watt was constantly in the backfield, generating five QB pressures; no other Cardinal had
                            more
                            than
