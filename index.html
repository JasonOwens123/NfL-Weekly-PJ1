            <p>Derek Carr: "It breaks my heart I didn't get an opportunity to say goodbye in person...
              Winning a championship is what I've always wanted and what I will continue to work towards";
              the Las Vegas Raiders benched the veteran QB for their final two games, both losses, as they
              finished 6-11</p>

                J.J. Watt on retirement: 'I know I still can (play), I'm just choosing not to'</b></h2>
            <p id="RomoP">Watt indeed showed he can still play, sacking 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy twice in
              Arizona's
              loss
              to
              San Francisco on Sunday and adding five tackles (three for loss) and a pass defensed. In the

              game
              of his 12-year career,
              Watt was constantly in the backfield, generating five QB pressures; no other Cardinal had
              more
              than
              one. </p>
