            <h2>J.J. Watt on retirement: 'I know I still can (play), I'm just choosing not to'</h2>
            <p>Watt indeed showed he can still play, sacking 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy twice in Arizona's loss to
                San Francisco on Sunday and adding five tackles (three for loss) and a pass defensed. In the final game
                of his 12-year career,
                Watt was constantly in the backfield, generating five QB pressures; no other Cardinal had more than one.
