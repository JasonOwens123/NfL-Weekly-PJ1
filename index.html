            <p>Derek Carr: "It breaks my heart I didn't get an opportunity to say goodbye in person...
              Winning a championship is what I've always wanted and what I will continue to work towards";
              the Las Vegas Raiders benched the veteran QB for their final two games, both losses, as they
              finished 6-11</p>

            <p id="wattp">Watt indeed showed he can still play, sacking 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy twice in Arizona's
              loss toSan Francisco on Sunday and adding five tackles (three for loss) and a pass defensed. In the
              final game of his 12-year career, Watt was constantly in the backfield, generating five QB pressures; no
              other Cardinal
              had more than one. </p>

            <h2>Patrick Mahomes ankle injury: Chiefs QB leaves media availability without a walking boot</h2>
            <img src="" height=80px; width=80px;>
            <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will practice Wednesday after participating in the team's
              walkthrough in the morning, according to head coach Andy Reid, and it appears as though the 2022 All-Pro
              quarterback won't be very limited when he does hit the practice field. Mahomes exited his press conference
              on Wednesday without either a walking boot or noticeable limp.

            <img src="" height=80px; width=80px;>
            <p>In the wake of a bitter season-ending loss, Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs let his reactions
              and social media do his talking.
              Diggs was clearly upset in the aftermath of the Bills' 27-10 Divisional Round loss to the Cincinnati
              Bengals and Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane has no qualms with the fire he saw from Diggs.</p>
